# 206Assignment
How can you see into my eyes, like open doors

Leading you down into my core

Where I've become so numb, without a soul

My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold

Until you find it there and lead it back homeWake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,

Wake me up inside, save me,

Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up

Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up

Before I come undone, save me

Save me from the nothing I've becomeNow that I know what I'm without

You can't just leave me

Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life
